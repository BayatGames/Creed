# Bayat Creed

This document outlines the core principles that guide our work, our interactions, and our approach to creation. Born from a desire to operate from a place of presence, authenticity, and flow, these principles serve as both our compass and our commitment. They reflect our values as we navigate the dynamic landscapes of technology, internet, software, and gaming.

We believe that *how* we do things is as important as *what* we do. These principles are intentionally concise, acting as anchors for mindful action and genuine connection.
